# COMPLEXITY

Complexity of code is depends upon many factors but for interview perspective, we will check only input factors in code. \
Calculate time for each statement in code. \
For Arithmatic, Logical, Assignment, return statement takes one unit of time. \
Example, 
\
```
return a+b;
```
-->  above statement has two factors one is return and second is a+b, So both will execute one time each irrespective of input variables. \
     In this case, T(n) = 2 always which is constant function.
